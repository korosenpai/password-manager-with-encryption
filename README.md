# password manager


# entering
if its the first time using this manager, the password used will be used to encrypt the files from now on. \
IMPORTANT: the password will not be stored anywhere, so be sure to remember it! \
to change the access password you must delete the "passwords.encrypted" file (attention, this will remove all passwords saved)

also when the password entered is wrong, it will throw an error while trying to decode, in tthat case just reinput the password

# installation
